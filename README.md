Details about Project: 

Software that controls the hiring and recruitment process, including job and application processes, is known as an applicant tracking system (ATS). It aggregates and makes searchable information about job searchers. An ATS follows applicants throughout the recruiting process, as its name suggests.

Workflow or Function Cycle of an ATS:

The steps listed below make up a typical recruitment process:

•	The system generates and, if required, approves the task request.

•	As fresh applications are sent, the ATS may analyze resumes and rank them accordingly.

•	The recruiter goes through the system's applications and chooses which ones to pursue further. applicants who are not chosen could get an automatic email rejecting them.

•	Interviews with the hiring manager, recruiter, and other parties may be conducted as needed. After each interview, notes can be added to the applicant tracking system (ATS) for future use.

•	The recruiter will often utilize the applicant tracking system (ATS) to deliver the offer to the chosen prospect.

•	The candidate is "hired" into the HR system if they accept the offer.
